### üß† Prompt to Paste into Replit AI / Developer

> Build a simple web-based seller onboarding platform for Bellu Kart.

> The goal is to let a D2C brand activate Bellu Kart‚Äôs 10-minute delivery infrastructure **without creating a storefront**. Most sellers already have their own websites.

---

### ‚úÖ Core Features:

1. **Onboarding Form** (Frontend)

   * Brand Name (text)
   * Website URL (text)
   * Email (text)
   * Phone Number (text)
   * Category (dropdown: Personal Care, Wellness, Fashion, Electronics, Other)
   * Expected Monthly Orders (number, optional)
   * Submit button ‚Üí `Activate Infra`

2. **Backend Logic (Node.js + Express or Python Flask)**

   * When form is submitted:

     * Save seller info to in-memory store or simple JSON DB
     * Generate a fake API key like `bk_seller_3942dfj3`
     * Redirect to `/success`

3. **Success Page**

   * Show:

     * ‚úÖ ‚ÄúBellu Infra Activated‚Äù
     * API Key: `bk_seller_xxxxxx`
     * Webhook URL: `https://bellu.ai/webhook/orders`
     * Button: **‚ÄúView API Docs‚Äù** ‚Üí links to `/docs`
   * Optionally: a message like:

     > ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll receive integration steps via email. Our team will contact you within 24 hours.‚Äù

4. **API Docs Page (`/docs`)**

   * Include basic webhook format:

     ```json
     {
       "order_id": "xyz123",
       "items": ["Toothpaste", "Shampoo"],
       "total_price": 480,
       "delivery_address": "Indiranagar, Bengaluru",
       "pickup_point": "Bellandur Dark Store"
     }
     ```
   * Add sections:

     * Authentication with API Key
     * Webhook sample payload
     * Order creation API (optional)
     * Support contact

5. **Bonus**

   * Mobile responsive
   * Use Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap
   * Option to copy API Key easily (copy button)
   * Hosted preview on Replit

### üîë Final Notes:

* This is **infra onboarding**, not a storefront builder.
* Don‚Äôt add product upload or store links.
* Focus on making integration feel instant and simple.
* Assume Bellu Kart handles routing + delivery behind the scenes.

Let me know if you want a **fully working version of this** built here with:

* Frontend + backend code
* Integration email copy
* Swagger-style API documentation

Just say: **"Generate full code and docs"**.
